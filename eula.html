                </ol>

                <h3>2.3 Reservation of Rights</h3>
                <p>Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted. The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor retains all Intellectual Property Rights.</p>

                <h2>ARTICLE 3: DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY COMPLIANCE</h2>
                <h3>3.1 Privacy by Design</h3>
                <p>The Software implements privacy by design per GDPR Article 25:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Biometric Data Minimization:</strong> <strong>The Software is technically incapable of storing Biometric Data of Unknown Persons.</strong> The processing pipeline automatically discards all facial embeddings, geometry, and photographs for non-enrolled individuals within 100 milliseconds. Only anonymized event logs ("Unknown person detected at [time]") are retained.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consent-Based Enrollment:</strong> Biometric Data processed only for Enrolled Persons with explicit consent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Localization:</strong> All data processed locally unless cloud features explicitly enabled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Deletion:</strong> Configurable retention periods with automatic purging.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
                <p><strong>Licensee is Data Controller</strong> for all Personal Data processed through the Software. Licensee determines purposes, obtains consents, provides notices, and ensures compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Licensor is Data Processor</strong> only when processing on Licensee's behalf through cloud services, acting only per documented instructions.</p>

                <h3>3.3 Biometric Data Compliance and Technical Enforcement</h3>
                <p>Licensee acknowledges:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Biometric Data is special category data under GDPR Article 9 and subject to BIPA and similar laws;</li>
                    <li>Licensee must obtain explicit consent from Enrolled Persons;</li>
                    <li>Licensee must provide written retention and destruction policies;</li>
                    <li>Licensee must NOT sell, lease, or profit from Biometric Data;</li>
                    <li>Licensee must protect Biometric Data with reasonable care.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS:</strong> The Software implements the following architectural safeguards to enforce privacy compliance:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hardcoded Privacy Controls:</strong> The Software's core processing pipeline contains non-configurable code that automatically discards facial embeddings, facial geometry data, and detailed VLM descriptions for any person not matched against the Enrolled Persons database. This behavior cannot be disabled through configuration, API calls, or user interface settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enrollment Verification:</strong> Before storing any Biometric Data, the Software requires affirmative enrollment action through the designated enrollment interface, which logs the enrollment event with timestamp, enrolling user, and consent acknowledgment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Data Purging:</strong> Temporary processing buffers containing facial data for Unknown Persons are purged from memory within 100 milliseconds of the non-match determination. No disk writes occur for Unknown Person biometric data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> All biometric processing events are logged to an immutable audit trail including: enrollment events, recognition attempts, match/non-match outcomes, and data deletion events. Logs are retained for the Subscription Term plus three (3) years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tamper Detection:</strong> Modification of privacy-enforcing code modules triggers integrity verification failures that disable biometric processing functionality until the Software is restored to an unmodified state.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>LICENSEE CIRCUMVENTION PROHIBITION:</strong> Any attempt by Licensee to circumvent, disable, modify, or bypass the Technical Enforcement Mechanisms described above constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may constitute a criminal offense under applicable computer fraud and data protection laws. Such circumvention shall immediately terminate all licenses granted hereunder and Licensee shall be liable for all damages arising therefrom, including statutory damages under BIPA (currently $1,000-$5,000 per violation) and GDPR administrative fines (up to €20,000,000 or 4% of annual worldwide turnover).</p>

                <h3>3.4 EU AI Act Compliance and Prohibited Uses</h3>
                <p>Per Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (the "EU AI Act"):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Software for biometric identification of Enrolled Persons in private spaces is classified as limited-risk AI;</li>
                    <li>Software is NOT designed, intended, or licensed for high-risk real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces;</li>
                    <li>Licensee shall ensure human oversight per Article 14 and not rely solely on automated decisions;</li>
                    <li>Licensee shall maintain records demonstrating compliance with applicable AI Act requirements.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>DEFINITION OF MASS SURVEILLANCE:</strong> For purposes of this Agreement, "Mass Surveillance" means any of the following prohibited uses:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Indiscriminate Public Monitoring:</strong> Deployment of the Software to continuously monitor, track, or identify members of the general public in publicly accessible spaces (streets, parks, shopping centers, transportation hubs) without individualized suspicion or specific security justification;</li>
                    <li><strong>Population-Scale Biometric Databases:</strong> Use of the Software to build, contribute to, or query biometric databases containing data on more than 1,000 individuals who have not provided explicit consent for such inclusion;</li>
                    <li><strong>Dragnet Surveillance:</strong> Configuration of the Software to capture and retain biometric data on all persons entering a monitored area, rather than limiting processing to Enrolled Persons and generating only anonymized event logs for Unknown Persons;</li>
                    <li><strong>Government Mass Surveillance Programs:</strong> Integration of the Software with any government program designed to monitor political activities, religious practices, ethnic communities, or other protected characteristics of populations;</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Jurisdictional Tracking:</strong> Use of the Software to track individuals across multiple unrelated premises, organizations, or jurisdictions without lawful authority and individual consent.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>PROHIBITED AI PRACTICES (EU AI Act Article 5):</strong> Licensee SHALL NOT use the Software for:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Social Scoring:</strong> Evaluating or classifying natural persons based on social behavior or personality characteristics, where such evaluation leads to detrimental treatment disproportionate to the context;</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:</strong> Targeting persons due to age, disability, or social/economic situation in ways that materially distort their behavior and cause significant harm;</li>
                    <li><strong>Subliminal Manipulation:</strong> Deploying techniques beyond a person's consciousness to materially distort behavior in ways causing significant harm;</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification in Public Spaces:</strong> Using the Software for law enforcement purposes to identify natural persons in real-time in publicly accessible spaces, except as explicitly permitted under Article 5(1)(h) with appropriate judicial authorization;</li>
                    <li><strong>Emotion Recognition in Workplace/Education:</strong> Inferring emotions of natural persons in workplace or educational contexts, except for medical or safety purposes;</li>
                    <li><strong>Biometric Categorization for Protected Characteristics:</strong> Categorizing natural persons based on biometric data to deduce race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious beliefs, sex life, or sexual orientation.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3.5 International Transfers</h3>
