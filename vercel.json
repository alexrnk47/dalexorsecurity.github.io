{
  "buildCommand": "node build.js",
  "outputDirectory": "public"
}
```

**3. Make sure your `build.js` script actually creates the `public` folder** and puts your built files in it.

**4. Test locally** by running:
```
npm run build
```

Then check if a `public` folder appeared in your project directory.

**If the folder was created, commit and push:**
```
git add .
git commit -m "Fix build output directory"
git push -u origin master
